Python (Jupyter) Notebooks fitting the Covid19 developments in Denmark

The code uses both publicly available data (from Epidemologisk Rapport by Statens Serum Institute (SSI)) for general developments in Denmark, but also non-public data (from WGS of positive samples) for determining the development of B.1.1.7 in Denmark.

The code was developed by Troels C. Petersen (Niels Bohr Institute) with contributions from students assisting the project (Albert, Julie, Peter, Kimi, and Magnus).
